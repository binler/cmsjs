CMS.js is fully client-side, Javascript site generator in the spirit of [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
that uses plain ol' HTML, CSS and Javascript to generate your website. CMS.js is like a file-based CMS.
It takes your content, renders Markdown and delivers a complete website in Single-Page
App fashion...without the aid of server-side scripting (no Node.js, PHP, Ruby, etc.).
